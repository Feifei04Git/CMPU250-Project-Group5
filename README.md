# CMPU250_Project
This repository contains our group project for Vassar College's CMPU250 Data and Its Discontents (Fall 2025), completed by Judah Govine, Ruofei Yao, and Yifei Qu. Throughout this work, we perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and reporting on our chosen dataset as part of the course requirements.
