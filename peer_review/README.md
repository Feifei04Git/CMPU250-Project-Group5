This folder contains our peer review feedback for Group 3's project's preliminary analysis.

We've incorporated all feedback given by our peers and finalized our project's final report in the report folder, including adding descriptions of relevant variables, adding formal citations at the end for our data source and all cited articles, adding highlights from EDA to show the connection between variables, answering the main research question in the Results section, and commenting codes and labeling code chunks.
